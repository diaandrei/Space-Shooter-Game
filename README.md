Brief Description of the Game:

This game is a space shooter where you take control of a spaceship battling against waves of enemies. You move the spaceship using W, A, S, D or the arrow keys, and you fire using the left mouse click or the Space key.
Enemies spawn in waves of three at random intervals, and after every third wave, a tougher boss enemy appears. Defeating regular enemies gets you 50 points each, while boss enemies yield a massive 1000 and 2000 points each.
From the main menu, you can choose to Play or Quit. The objective is to survive as long as possible, defeating as many enemies as possible to achieve the highest score. The player's spaceship starts with 100 health points, depicted by a health bar on the left. The game concludes when the player's health is fully depleted, taking you to a 'Game Over' scene with options to replay the game or return to the main menu.
Throughout the game, a looping background audio track sets the mood, with added sound effects for dealing and taking damage. The backdrop is a constantly scrolling galaxy, crafted from three separate sprites, adding depth to the cosmic setting.

Controls for the Game:
•	W/Up Arrow: Move spaceship up
•	A/Left Arrow: Move spaceship left
•	S/Down Arrow: Move spaceship down
•	D/Right Arrow: Move spaceship right
•	Left Mouse Click/Space key: Shoot
In the 'Game Over' scene and the main menu, you interact with the buttons using the left mouse click.
Enjoy the game and may the stars guide your way!
